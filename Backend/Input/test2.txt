Good morning everyone. Let's start with yesterday's progress.
Alice: Yesterday, I finished integrating the user authentication service. I also wrote unit tests for the login endpoint. Today, I plan to start working on password reset functionality. I don't have any blockers right now.
Bob: I wrapped up the UI for the dashboard analytics yesterday. I started writing documentation for the frontend components. Today, I need help clarifying some requirements about the export feature. I will sync with Charlie later.
Charlie: I completed the backend APIs for the reporting module. There were some challenges with database indexing, but I resolved them. Today, I'll help Bob with the export functionality.
Project Manager: Thanks everyone. Quick reminder â€” the sprint demo is scheduled for Friday. Please ensure your JIRA tickets are updated by Thursday end of day.
Alice: Got it.
Bob: Will do.
Charlie: No issues from my side.
Project Manager: Alright, have a productive day!
Meeting adjourned.
